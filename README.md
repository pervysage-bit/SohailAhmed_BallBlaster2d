# SohailAhmed_BallBlaster2d

The game i choose was ball blaster from task, the reason to pick this game was to get more familiar with physics component in unity.
i have tried almost very thing that i leared in past 2 weeks on unity learn.

Some of the mechanics in this game was hard for me, like i didint add collision as same as the game requried.
The balls are spawning only from left x-axis.
The collision between the 2 balls were occuring, i was failed to solve that problem.
i didint do any UI.
